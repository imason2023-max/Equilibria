# Recovery-Aware Training App

This project is a mobile fitness app that adjusts workout intensity based on a user's recovery.
It combines self-reported data (sleep, soreness, energy) with wearable data (HRV, heart rate)
to generate a daily recovery score and training recommendation (heavy, light, or rest).

## Project Structure

- `backend/` — FastAPI backend (APIs, recovery logic, database models)
- `frontend/` — React Native mobile app (screens, components, navigation)
- `design/` — Figma link and exported UI assets
- `docs/` — Architecture, API reference, and project documentation

## Getting Started

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` (if you add one) for details.
